        <h3>Data Analysis Results</h3>
        Our geographic map gave us some information – but we want to know if there is more to the story.  So we looked a little deeper at this relationship.  Our first chart is just a scatterplot of the components of the affordability index.  Again – you can see that California and Hawaii are outliers (good reasonableness check on the two charts).  You can also see that there does seem to be a pattern of both median salaries and median house prices increasing together.  You could draw a gently positively sloped regression line that would do a pretty good job of capturing this relationship.  The problem is, the slope isn’t large enough to maintain a constant affordability index.  Initial inspection suggests that while salary does increase as housing prices increase – it does NOT increase as quickly.  For that to be the case, you would need to have a regression line through any of these points with a slope equal to the affordability index.  Our next graph further illustrates this suspicion.
